&lt;p>This seminar provides a comprehensive overview of optimization algorithms, covering both theoretical foundations and practical applications. We begin with advanced convex programming techniques, including the Alternating Direction Method with Gaussian Back Substitution and optimally linearized ADMM. The seminar then explores modern optimization methods such as Adam and generalized primalâ€“dual hybrid gradient approaches for saddle point problems. We also discuss communication-efficient statistical estimation and the balanced augmented Lagrangian method. Further topics include the global linear convergence of ADMM with multi-block variables, decentralized consensus optimization via the EXTRA algorithm, and stochastic gradient descent with variance reduction. Finally, we examine the role of optimization in double descent and investigate why overparameterized neural networks can still generalize effectively.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This seminar offers a comprehensive exploration of statistical computing using Python, starting with fundamental Python programming and progressing into deep learning and optimization techniques. Topics include computer vision, image processing, and natural language processing (NLP), as well as advanced deep learning models. The seminar also introduces reinforcement learning, covering classical algorithms, Deep Q-Learning, and Policy Gradient (PG) methods, along with their practical applications. Additionally, it delves into distributed computing, providing an overview of Ray and its API for parallel deep learning and reinforcement learning with Ray RLlib. This seminar serves as a technical guide for students and researchers seeking to apply Python in statistical computing and AI-driven problem-solving.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This seminar explores the fusion of mechanistic modeling and statistical inference, presenting a range of methodologies for parameter estimation, curve fitting, and uncertainty quantification. Beginning with an introduction to mechanistic models, it covers nonlinear least squares, trajectory matching, and nonparametric curve fitting with roughness penalties. Advanced topics include gradient matching, generalized profiled estimation, and local polynomial methods. We further examine equation matching techniques and sparse additive models for ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The seminar also delves into Gaussian processes and their applications in ODE modeling, culminating in a discussion on the novel use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for analyzing Argo data.&lt;/p>
