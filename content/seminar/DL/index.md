## Abstract 

Our seminar progresses from foundational concepts and text analysis to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), emphasizing image classification and optimization techniques. It explores deep learning applications in natural language processing and computer vision (object detection, semantic segmentation), followed by reinforcement learning principles. Specialized topics include methods for graph-based/non-Euclidean data and medical image analysis, providing a concise yet broad technical overview across key domains.
