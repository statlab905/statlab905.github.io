## Abstract
This seminar offers a comprehensive exploration of statistical computing using Python, starting with fundamental Python programming and progressing into deep learning and optimization techniques. Topics include computer vision, image processing, and natural language processing (NLP), as well as advanced deep learning models. The seminar also introduces reinforcement learning, covering classical algorithms, Deep Q-Learning, and Policy Gradient (PG) methods, along with their practical applications. Additionally, it delves into distributed computing, providing an overview of Ray and its API for parallel deep learning and reinforcement learning with Ray RLlib. This seminar serves as a technical guide for students and researchers seeking to apply Python in statistical computing and AI-driven problem-solving.
