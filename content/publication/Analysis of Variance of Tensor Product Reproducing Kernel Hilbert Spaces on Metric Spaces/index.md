abstract: Many methods have been developed to analyze complex data, such as non-Euclidean shape, network, and manifold data. However, there is a lack of methods for studying interactions among complex data. In this article, we first propose a novel kernel function for a metric space and construct its associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The new nonstationary kernel function provides a flexible and powerful tool for learning complex structures in non-Euclidean data. We then construct an analysis of variance (ANOVA) decomposition of the nonparametric regression function defined on metric space, which provides a hierarchical structure for investigating the main effects and interactions. We develop estimation and computational methods for a semi-parametric model with a multivariate function on a product of metric spaces modeled by the ANOVA decomposition. We establish the convergence rates of parameter and nonparametric function estimates. The application of the proposed methods to the Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative hippocampus shape data confirms some existing and suggests some new interactions among hippocampal regions. Simulations indicate that the proposed methods work well. Supplementary materials for this article are available online, including a standardized description of the materials available for reproducing the work.
