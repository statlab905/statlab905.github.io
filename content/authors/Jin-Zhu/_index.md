I'm a Ph.D. candidate working with Prof. [Xueqin Wang](https://bs.ustc.edu.cn/english/profile-650.html) in the School of Mathematics, SYSU since 2019. I am interested in developing computationally efficient algorithms & softwares with statistical performance guarantees for large scale non-Euclidean/high-dimensional data analysis.
