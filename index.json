The selection for best subset shows great value in scientific researches and practical applications. For example, clinicians want to know whether a patient is healthy or not based on the expression levels of a few of important genes.\nThis library implements a generic algorithm framework to find the optimal solution in an extremely fast way. This framework now supports the detection of best subset under: linear regression, classification (binary or multi-class), counting-response modeling, censored-response modeling, multi-response modeling (multi-tasks learning), etc. It also supports the variants of best subset selection like group best subset selection, nuisance penalized regression, Especially, the time complexity of (group) best subset selection for linear regression is certifiably polynomial.\nQuick start The abess software has both Python and R’s interfaces. Here a quick start will be given and for more details, please view: Installation.\nPython package Install the stable version of Python-package from Pypi:\n$ pip install abess or conda-forge:\n$ conda install abess Best subset selection for linear regression on a simulated dataset in Python:\nfrom abess.linear import LinearRegression from abess.datasets import make_glm_data sim_dat = make_glm_data(n = 300, p = 1000, k = 10, family = \u0026#34;gaussian\u0026#34;) model = LinearRegression() model.fit(sim_dat.x, sim_dat.y) See more examples analyzed with Python in the Python tutorials.\nR package Install the stable version of R-package from CRAN with:\ninstall.packages(\u0026#34;abess\u0026#34;) Best subset selection for linear regression on a simulated dataset in R:\nlibrary(abess) sim_dat \u0026lt;- generate.data(n = 300, p = 1000) abess(x = sim_dat[[\u0026#34;x\u0026#34;]], y = sim_dat[[\u0026#34;y\u0026#34;]]) See more examples analyzed with R in the R tutorials.\nRuntime Performance To show the power of abess in computation, we assess its timings of the CPU execution (seconds) on synthetic datasets, and compare to state-of-the-art variable selection methods. The variable selection and estimation results are deferred to Python performance and R performance. All computations are conducted on a Ubuntu platform with Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9940X CPU @ 3.30GHz and 48 RAM.\nPython package We compare abess Python package with scikit-learn on linear regression and logistic regression. Results are presented in the below figure:\nIt can be see that abess uses the least runtime to find the solution.\nR package We compare abess R package with three widely used R packages: glmnet, ncvreg, and L0Learn. We get the runtime comparison results:\nCompared with other packages, abess shows competitive computational efficiency, and achieves the best computational power when variables have a large correlation.\nOpen source software abess is a free software and its source code is publicly available on Github. The core framework is programmed in C++, and user-friendly R and Python interfaces are offered. You can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GPL-v3 License. We welcome contributions for abess, especially stretching abess to the other best subset selection problems.\nWhat’s news New features:\nabess Python package can be installed via conda. abess R package is is highlighted as one of the core packages in CRAN Task View: Machine Learning \u0026amp; Statistical Learning. On Windows, the recommended C++ compiler shifts from Mingw to Microsoft Visual Studio. Support predicting survival function in abess.linear.CoxPHSurvivalAnalysis. Rename estimators in Python.

Furthermore, it supports common variants like best subset of groups selection and ridge-regularized best-subset selection. The core of the library is programmed in C++.
